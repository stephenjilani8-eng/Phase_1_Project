# Phase_1_Project
The project is relates to an aviation company that deals with the purchase and operation of aircrafts on a commercial and private basis. The company is in the process of expanding into new markets and need to make a decision on the lowest risk aircrafts
The data provided for the project is from the National Safety Transportation Board and is for aircraft accidents occuring from 2018 to 2022.
The data has information relating to accident dates, aircraft type, the operator, the damages that occured and fatalities among other information which has been used in a minimal level in the project.
The project has started with data cleaning which has removed missing information, has changes formatting, has removed duplicates, has dropped irrelevant colums etc in order to prepare the data for analysis.
The cleaned dataset has been exported to CSV format and imported into Tableau for analysis. The analysis has been done from the perspective of aircrafts with the least accidents,least fatalities, the year which has had the least accidents to make it the best year to be considered in choosing the best candidate for the aircraft to purchase.
Visuals have been prepared on Tableau to represent the analysis above and the link to the visuals is presented below.
